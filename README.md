# PHP-Composer

This is [PHP Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer), debianized.

## Installation

This is packaged on Launchpad, at [https://launchpad.net/composer](https://launchpad.net/composer).

Add the PPA:

```
apt-add-repository -y ppa:duggan/composer
apt-get update
```

Then install with:

```
apt-get install php5-composer
```

## Updates

Releases are tagged with a date, as the composer project itself does not hold
to any useful versioning mechanism.

The PPA is set up for daily builds, though I expect this to settle into a
roughly weekly cadence of release.

To update:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install --only-upgrade php5-composer
```

Updating this just requires running “update.sh” from the root of the repository (and pushing the result to master, along with the the tags). After that, the imports and source package recipes on Launchpad take care of the builds.
